Password Manager for Android
A secure and easy-to-use password manager for Android devices that keeps your sensitive information safe. Built with robust AES encryption and multiple authentication layers, this app ensures that your digital life is protected.

🌟 About The Project
In an era where digital security is paramount, managing dozens of passwords can be a daunting task. This Password Manager application provides a secure vault for all your credentials, accessible only to you. It simplifies password management without compromising on security, offering features like biometric authentication, encrypted backups, and a user-friendly interface.

✨ Features
Strong Encryption: All your data is encrypted using the AES-256 standard, one of the most secure encryption algorithms available. Your data is encrypted on-device before it's ever stored.

Multi-Layered Security:

Biometric Authentication: Quickly and securely unlock your vault using your fingerprint or face recognition.

PIN Protection: A reliable PIN as a primary or fallback authentication method.

Data Backup & Restore:

Encrypted Backups: Generate a secure, encrypted backup file of your entire vault. You can store this file offline or in a cloud service of your choice.

Easy Import: Restore your data from a backup file with just a few taps.

Auto-Export: Set up automatic backups to ensure your latest data is always saved, preventing accidental data loss.

Secure Credential Storage: Store various types of credentials, including website logins, app passwords, and secure notes.

User-Friendly Interface: A clean, intuitive design that makes managing your passwords a breeze.

🔐 Security
Security is the core foundation of this application. Here’s how we protect your data:

End-to-End Encryption: Your data is encrypted with a master password-derived key using AES-256. The data is only decrypted locally on your device when you successfully authenticate. Your master password or PIN is never stored.

Key Derivation: We use robust key derivation functions (like PBKDF2 or Argon2) to protect your master password against brute-force attacks.

No Cloud Storage: By default, your data lives only on your device. We do not have access to your credentials. You have full control over your encrypted backup files.
