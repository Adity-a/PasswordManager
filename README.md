## üîê Security Model

Security is the core foundation of this application.

* **End-to-End Encryption:** Your data is encrypted with a master password-derived key using **AES-256**. It is only decrypted locally on your device when you successfully authenticate.
* **Zero Knowledge:** Your master password or PIN is never stored. We do not have access to your credentials.
* **Robust Key Derivation:** We use key derivation functions (like PBKDF2 or Argon2) to protect your master password against brute-force attacks.
* **Offline First:** By default, your data lives only on your device. You have full control over your encrypted backup files.
